# ðŸŽ² React Backgammon

React implementation of Backgammon.

## Basic rules

- The objective of the game is to move all of your pieces off the board before your opponent does.
- The game is played on a board with 24 triangular points, or "points," arranged in four quadrants.
- Each player starts with 15 pieces, or "checkers," of their own color, on the board in specific starting positions.
- Players take turns rolling two dice and moving their pieces according to the numbers rolled. The numbers on the dice must be used together, and a piece can only be moved to an open point.
- A player can move a piece to a point occupied by one of their own pieces, called a "blot," which can then be hit by an opponent's piece. If a player's blot is hit, the piece is placed on the bar and must re-enter the board on the opponent's home board before continuing to move.
- If a player rolls doubles, they can move four times the number rolled for each piece.
- A player can "bear off," or remove, their pieces from the board once they have moved all of their pieces to their home board.
- If a player cannot make a legal move, they forfeit their turn.
- The game can be played with a doubling cube, which allows a player to increase the stakes of the game by offering to double the current stakes.
- The first player to bear off all of their pieces wins the game, and the value of the stakes is awarded to the winner.

## Additional rules

- A player can use one die to move a piece if the other die is not a legal move.
- A player can move a piece to a point occupied by two or more of their own pieces, called a "stack," but the piece on top of the stack must be moved first.
- A player can only bear off a piece if all of their pieces are on their home board and all of the points in their home board are closed.
- A player can only hit a blot if the point being hit is open, or if the point being hit is occupied by a single opposing piece.
- A player can only hit an opponent's blot if the point being hit is open, or if the point being hit is occupied by a single opposing piece and the player has at least two pieces on the bar.
- A player can only hit an opponent's blot if the point being hit is open, or if the point being hit is occupied by a single opposing piece and the player has at least two pieces on the bar.
- A player can use the doubling cube to offer a gammon, which is worth twice the stakes of the game, or a backgammon, which is worth three times the stakes of the game.
- A player can only offer a gammon or backgammon if they have at least one piece on the opponent's home board or if the opponent has not borne off any pieces.
- A player can forfeit the game if they feel they have no chance of winning.
- A player can request to use a clock to limit the time for each move.
